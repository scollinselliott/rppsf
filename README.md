The following page outlines the technical steps in evaluating the prevlance of different behaviors at archaeological sites through their small finds assemblages, using the case of seven sites in the comune of Cinigiano (GR) in south central Tuscany, excavated by the Roman Peasant Project (RPP), from 2009 to 2014.

The paper for which this method has been developed is currently under review with the Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology.

This project arose as a result of the need to deal with the fuzziness inherent in the categorization of archaeological finds, when dealing with objects which may have more than one use or function, or when their function may be uncertain, as a prelude to other forms of categorical data analysis that are predicated upon exclusive or independent categories.

Extrapolating from material finds to functions is well within the traditional bounds of the intepretive process of archaeological investigation.

When it comes to ascribing functions to finds, however, there can be many different activities and domains of use: for example, a ceramic mold for manufacturing votive terracottas is both evidence of religious activity, which can be seen as falling under the domain of culture, as well as ceramic production, which falls underneath craft production and the economy. Different objects may be of unclear function, but can nevertheless be ascribed to a range of activities and domains, and excluded from others (e.g., large iron collars are probably not worn as jewelry, as a personal or cultural artifact, but likely have some other utilitarian function in other domains).

This process, of the functional interpretation of artifacts, can be described suscinctly as an ontology, which relates each artifact to its range of potential activities and domains. Representing this ontology in the form of a graph is a useful visual way to conceptualize the interpretive connections that are drawn from object to behavior, with each node representing a find's code, its pertinent functions or activities, as well as broader domains of use.

For the sake of convenience, every find was a three-letter code, based off of those used in [Artefacts: Encyclopédie collaborative en ligne des objets archéologiques](http://artefacts.mom.fr/en/codes.php), with a few additions. The full list of definitions can be found [here](https://github.com/scollinselliott/rppsf/blob/master/data/rppsfcodes.csv).
